            As a passionate information technology student I enjoy making new things such as voice recognition Python programs and Flask APIs. 
            Starting my post-secondary life at SFU studying criminology, I did not enjoy the long hours of theory and book reading. 
            My initial trajectory was to become a police officer, a person that would follow the law and bring justice to people who did not. 
            The long lecture and class hours with Powerpoints and discussions with no actual hands-on experience made my expience lacking. 
            I was not engaged when participating in class which made it difficult to enjoy learning and keep important information in my head.
            <br><br> 
            Thoughtout my highschool and post-secondary years, I found that I enjoyed building things with my hands, such as my favorite hobbies Gunpla and model kits. 
            I was able to be myself while creating battle scenarios and dioramas and I was able to make projects to my liking. 
            This fueled my passion for IT, as it was a way for me to create un-imaginable projects with un-limited capability only limited to what was on my mind. 
            I decided to take a Computer Science Course during my final term at SFU. That's where I fell in love with coding, especially in Python.
            
            <span id="collapse">
                <br><br>
                I decided to go to the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) to pursue my creative career as an IT professional. 
                Not only have I gained knowledge about many programming languages and technologies such as Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and MySQL. 
                I have also met many friends and fellow creative minds that have expanded my learning at BCIT.
                <br><br>BCIT has taught my many things not only about the world of Information Technology, but also myself.
                I was able to learn many coding tools such as React, and Typescript, but also learning about the ethical impacts of IT and the business part of it.
                <br><br>
                With my new trajectory towards the IT sector, I am able to use my creativity to make the world better.
                Stiving to positively impact our world, I believe I can make a difference.

            <h3>CRUD Employee Management System &#128187</h3>
            <a href="https://cubetech-jwang-emp-database.herokuapp.com/" class="project_link">View Application</a>
            <p>This CRUD project was created in a agile method with a group of students. As a product owner, I had to keep track and create user stories our project had. In addition, I was the main Flask API programmer in the group.
              Using an Object Orientated Method to create classes, we designed an application that kept track of Employees within a business. 
              <span id="collapse-p1" style="display: none;">
                <br><br>
                With a group of 5 and within 5 weeks, we were able to create an application that allowed employees to be added, edited and deleted within a business.
                We stored this data using JSON, which I was most experience in, this allowed us to focus on instead of learning new technologies, to find new strategies to improve our skills.
                My primary focus on this CRUD application was to make sure that I was able to make this application as realistic as possible, such as encrypting sensitive data, and routing pages with an API.
                <br><br>
                Not only could a single business use the application, but multiple businesses could use this application with Logins containing encryped passwords. Using hashlib, I was able to encryp passwords to make them safe and secure.
                By storing each businesses/companies data within multiple separate json files, our application could retrieve the corrent information based on the login data. 
                To secure this data, our application used sessions to store session information to store a cache if the user wanted to use a new tab without logging back in.
                In addition, sessions allowed us to keep track of which information was needed to be shown. If the application was logged out, the session would end, and new credentials would have to be entered again to keep security.

            <h3>JavaScript Minigames &#127918</h3>
            <a href="https://jwang-js-hangman.herokuapp.com/" class="project_link">View Application</a>
            <p>This game project was my motivation to improve on my JavaScript syntax and my understanding of Javascript. 
              Most importantly, JavaScript's syntax is very similar to many other languages such as Java and C++.
              This API serves multiple pages through a Flask API to send multiple games such as Coding Language Hangman, 2 Player Tic-Tac-Toe, and guess the RGB Colour Code. 
              I learned new methods in JS such as the keydown eventlistener, which allowed me to record keyboard inputs for hangman.
              <span id="collapse-p2" style="display: none;">
                <br><br>
                By using a familiar Flask Python API, I was able to focus my work on creating an organized, but also functional code that allows games to be played multiple times with a click of a restart button. 
                Not only was I able to improve my Javascript techniques, such as using while and for loops, but I was able to understand more about onclick and eventlisteners. 
                Splitting my code into smaller functions allowed me to understand my code better, but also allowed me to fix bugs and issues related to certain functions faster, since everything was more organized.
                <br><br>
                Not only did I improve in JavaScript, but I was able to be more creative and understand CSS and HTML in a better way. I used a new element in HTML called svg's, which allowed me to draw the hangman character as letters were guessed incorrectly.
                I also improved my understanding of JS DOMs, which allowed me to change elements within an HTML to display inline, block, and to also hide elements with none;

            <p>
              My first Java project was one of the toughest projects I have ever tried. Even without designing a UI, or coding an API, coding fully in Java was the toughest.
              By using Java, I expanded my knowledge of using OOP and Classes.
              With the same syntax as JavaScript, it was fairly easy to understand and create code, but using multiple methods was difficult to understand in the beginning.<br><br>
              <em>Public Static void main string args!</em>
              <span id="collapse-p3" style="display: none;">
                <br><br>
                One of the most difficult challenges in Java was creating methods, having to declare if the method is public, private, and what variable it returns! 
                Oh man the challenges was making sure to declare the return type value at the start of the method. String? Integer? Boolean? Void?
                Making sure to declare an object to a class to allow it to use a function was also very difficult.
                The first few days creating this project was confusing! Realizing that I did not declare an object to a class so it cannot use a method drove me mad!
                <br><br>
                At the end, I was proud that I was able to create a OOP project! I realized that Java is still important in many companies, but the rumours are true...Java is hell!

            <p>
              To expand my coding language knowledge. I decided to create a C++ game show for the terminal. With the knowledge of the JS syntax, I was able to figure out quickly how to build the code.
              A challenge I faced was using #include to get modules that I needed to create the program. One feature I wanted to impliment was to use JSON to store the quiz questions.
              To use this, I had to understand how to get modules from Github, in which I used the nholmann module to get data from JSON.
              <span id="collapse-p4" style="display: none;">
              <br><br>
              Another challenge I faced was the function return value declarations such as Void, String, and Boolen. This was very similar to the Java Project, but without worrying about static, public, and private.
              Using &lt&lt and >> was fairly unfamiliar to me when printing strings into the terminal, but also to pipe information into variables. Instead of using =, using &lt&lt and >> was interesting.

              The first Python Project I created. Uses a CVS file to create a nested Python array. Within this nested python array contains RGB color codes which were manipulated to create images.
              This includes creating original images, greyscale, and can put vertical red lines. By using for loops, I was able to interact through every element within the array and sub arrays. 
  
                <br><br>
                Since this was my first ever major Python project, my biggest challenge was working with sub-arrays and loops to interact with each element. It took some time, as I was only familiar with normal lists.
                But with some time, I was able to understand the concept of lists in lists! This was not the only challenge. Saving the image onto the system was also a challenge as it was the first time doing this sort of thing.
                This project took about 3-4 weeks, but at the end, was something to be proud of.

          <p class="left">
            In grade 10, I was introduced to Gunpla, plastic model kits based off the Gundam Anime Robot Series. 
            Thoughtout the years, I have expanded from Gunpla into model planes, cars, and other figures. Based on the size and complexity of the model, it may take a few hours to a few weeks to fully complete one model.
            
            <br><br>
            To challenge myself, I learned how to airbrush and spray paint model kits to change their color, and I have also learned how to use weathering tools to make these model kits look more realistic.
            In addition, using tools such as hand-held drills and blades has allowed me to create realistic bullet holes and cracks in my models. 
            <br><br>
            Model kits has allowed me to practice patients when facing challenges, dedication, and creativity.

          <h3>Cars</h3>
          <p class="left">
            Driving and working with cars has taught me how to problem solve, but also planning and organization skills.
            There are many issues that can arise when modifying and driving cars, such as mechanical issues. 
            These issues can sometimes be challenging to solve, finding solutions to fix a problem or finding solutions to prevent the problem from happening.
            <br><br>
            Especially during Covid-19, gas prices have risen and it's now expensive to drive. 
            This has helped me build my planning skills, reducing the amount of trips and milage I need to drive, taking shorter routes, and routing my day to achieve multiple goals and places without wasting gas.

          <p class="left">
            As a proud formal member of the Pinetree Secondary SCPA Club, I have had a life-long passion to care and love animals. From going to the SPCA Summer Camp, to donating to the SPCA, pets and animals have been very important in my life.
            I have personally owned a few pets, such as a guinepig named Chubby, a hermet crab, and an upside down goldfish named Bubbles.
            <br><br>
            Benny (Image on the Left), is a funny, yet friendly pomeranian who has been in my life since 2020. A little crazy, he enjoys licking and chasing people on bikes! 
            He has taught me personally that having fun, taking breaks, and relaxing can be beneficial mentally. 
            <br><br>
            Bobby (Image on the Right), is a calm, relaxing, dedicated and trustworthy pomeranian who was in my entire life since 2019. He was loyal and would always be by the side of who he loves. He enjoyed walking around Stanley Park and walking around Lafarge Lake, eating cheese sandwiches in the morning.
            <br><br>
            Pet's take a lot of effort to take care of. Cleaning cages, picking up their waste, spending time with them, feeding them. It all takes work and effort, but pets also bring unexpected joy into your life.
